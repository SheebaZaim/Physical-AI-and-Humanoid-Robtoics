# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Chapter Goals

- Teach ROS 2 architecture
- Show nodes, topics, services, actions
- Explain URDF for humanoids

## ROS 2 Overview

![AI Image Prompt: High-level architectural diagram of ROS 2, showing its core components like DDS, RMW, nodes, and client libraries. Illustrate how different robotic functionalities are integrated.](static/img/ros2_nervous_system/ros2_overview.png)

## Nodes, Topics, Services

Content for this section will go here.

![AI Image Prompt: Diagram illustrating the communication mechanisms in ROS 2: Nodes exchanging data via Topics (publish/subscribe), Service calls (request/response), and Action goals (long-running tasks). Use clear arrows and labels.](static/img/ros2_nervous_system/nodes_topics_services.png)

## rclpy Basics
