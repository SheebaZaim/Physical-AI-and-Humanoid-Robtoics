# Foundations of Humanoid Robotics

## Chapter Goals

- Provide fundamental robotics concepts

## Kinematics & Dynamics

Content for this section will go here.

![AI Image Prompt: Detailed diagram illustrating the principles of kinematics and dynamics as applied to a multi-jointed humanoid robot arm. Show joint angles, link lengths, and forces/torques involved in movement.](static/img/robotics_foundations/kinematics_dynamics.png)

## Sensors & Perception

Content for this section will go here.

![AI Image Prompt: Infographic showing various sensors commonly used in humanoid robotics (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, IMU, tactile sensors) and how they contribute to the robot's perception of its environment.](static/img/robotics_foundations/sensors_perception.png)
